## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Code Reference: https://aosmith.rbind.io/2018/08/29/getting-started-simulating-data/

```{r }
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 1)

```

```{r using seed}

##If we set the seed prior to running rnorm(), we can reproduce the values we generate.
set.seed(16)
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
